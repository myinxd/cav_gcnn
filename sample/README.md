## Description of the dataset
The X-ray observations used in our work are listed in this folder, which are transformed into jpegs, and marked with corresponding ObsID (Observation ID) and scales (See as follows).

To fetch these observations, a python scipt namely [getSamples.py](https://github.com/myinxd/cavdet/blob/master/utils/getSamples.py) is provided, please enjoy yourself to build your own datasets. It should be noticed that a list file namely `objlist.txt` is required to apply our script, as well as the Chandra software [`CIAO`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/).
