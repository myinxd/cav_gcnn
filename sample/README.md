## Description of the dataset
The X-ray observations used in our work are listed in this folder, which are snapped as pictures, and marked with corresponding ObsID (Observation ID) and scales (See as follows). The snap of the selected samples marked with cavities is also illustrated in [objects_cav.png](https://github.com/myinxd/cav_gcnn/blob/master/sample/objects_cav.png)

To retrieve these observations, a python script namely [download_observations.py](https://github.com/myinxd/cav_gcnn/blob/master/data/download_observations.py) is provided, please enjoy yourself to build your own datasets. It should be noticed that a list file namely `objlist.txt` is required to apply our script, as well as the Chandra software [`CIAO`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/). The [objlist](https://github.com/myinxd/cav_gcnn/master/data/objlist.txt) in this work is also provided in this repository.
